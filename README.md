üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇ CV (resume) "RPG" üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

üìÖ April 2020

üëã Hey ! This project was my first one on Javascript !

This code represents my beginnings with this language.

I was taking some free online courses on OpenClassRooms to learn JavaScript, and I really enjoyed it!

The objective was to learn how to use addEventListeners and work with window borders. 
The exercise was to make a basketball rebound on each side of the window. 
However, I decided to make the ball move with the keyboard instead of automatically when we click start. 
That's how I got the idea to eventually move a character, but there was no specific goal.

Eventually, I decided to take the concept a step further and turn my CV into a mini-game. 
It works perfectly on a computer, allowing players to move the character using ZQSD or arrow keys. 
For mobile devices or other touch screens, I have implemented an option to "teleport" by simply clicking anywhere.

When you approach a safe, it will automatically open and display a modal with its contents.

I incorporated several projects to this one to show my learnings directly in this site. 
This is why you may see strange directory names. I will describe them :

‚ú® cv_simple ‚ú®

This is a version of my resume on a simple website, for those who don't want to mess with the character on the RPG version.
You can access this site by a link in the first information modal when you arrive on the site.

‚ú® gestion_bdd ‚ú®

This was my first project/exercice with PHP / MySQL and a database.
I just simulated a customer directory with their information.

‚ú® paneladmin ‚ú®


Paneladmin was only for me, all contact forms from cv-rpg / cv-simple and travellingfirst.com did not send an email 
but instead stored the data in a database, and I accessed this information through the paneladmin.

‚ú® tableaux_javascript ‚ú®

This was the first javascript exercise on numbers and comparisons.
