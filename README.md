🚶‍♂ CV "RPG" 🚶‍♂️ 

📅 April 2020

👋 Hey ! This project was my first one on Javascript !

This code represents my beginnings with this language.

I was taking some free online courses on OpenClassRooms to learn JavaScript, and I really enjoyed it!

The objective was to learn how to use addEventListeners and work with window borders. 
The exercise was to make a basketball rebound on each side of the window. 
However, I decided to make the ball move with the keyboard instead of automatically when we click start. 
That's how I got the idea to eventually move a character, but there was no specific goal.

Eventually, I decided to take the concept a step further and turn my CV into a mini-game. 
It works perfectly on a computer, allowing players to move the character using ZQSD or arrow keys. 
For mobile devices or other touch screens, I have implemented an option to "teleport" by simply clicking anywhere.

When you approach a safe, it will automatically open and display a modal with its contents.
